section 2.2. 

1. Three dice are tossed, one red, one blue, and one green. What outcomes make up the 
event A that the sum of the three faces showing equals 5? 

2. Let P be the set of right triangles with a 5" hypotenuse and whose height and length 
are a and b, respectively. Characterize the outcomes in P. 

3. Find \(A \cap B \cap C\) if \(A = \{x : 0 \le x \le 4\}\), \(B = \{x : 2 \le x \le 6\}\), and 
C = {x : x = 0,1,2,...}.

4. Let A₁,A₂,.....,Aₖ be any set of events defined on a sample space S. What outcomes
    belong to the event (A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪...∪ Aₖ) ∪ (A₁ᶜ ∩ Aₖᶜ).

5. Let A and B be any two events. Use Venn diagrams to show that

      (a) the complement of their intersection is the union of their complements:
          (A ∩ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ
(b) the complement of their union is the intersection of their complements: (A ∪ B)ᴄ =

Aᴄ ∩ Bᴄ

(These two results are known as DeMorgan's laws.)

section 2.3

1. Let A and B be any two events defined on S. Suppose that P(A) = 0.4, P(B) = 0.5,

and P(A ∩ B) = 0.1. What is the probability that A or B but not both occur?
2. Draw the Venn diagrams that would correspond to the equations (a) 𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐵)
and (b) 𝑃(𝐴∪𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐵).

3. Two dice are tossed. Assume that each possible outcome has a $\frac{1}{36}$ probability. Let 𝐴
be the event that the sum of the faces showing is 6, and let 𝐵 be the event that the
face showing on one die is twice the face showing on the other. Calculate 𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵^{𝐶}).
tive failure, and grit, in general.

1. Three dice are tossed, one red, one blue, and one green. What outcomes make up the event A that the sum of the three faces showing equals 5?

\((1,1,3)\)  
\((1,2,2)\)  
\((2,1,2)\)  
\((1,3,1)\)  
\((3,1,1)\)  
\((2,2,1)\)  

2. Let P be the set of right triangles with a 5" hypotenuse and whose height and length are a and b, respectively. Characterize the outcomes in P.

\[a^2+b^2=5^2\]
\(a^2 + b^2 = 25\)

\(a, b \mid a^2 + b^2 = 25, a > 0, b > 0\)

3. Find \(A \cap B \cap C\) if \(A = \{x : 0 \leq x \leq 4\}, B = \{x : 2 \leq x \leq 6\},\) and

\(C = \{x : x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}.\)

\(A \cap B = \{x : 2 \leq x \leq 4\}\)

\(A \cap B \cap C = \{2, 3, 4\}\)

4) \(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ldots \cup A_k \lor ( A_1^c \cap \ldots \cap A_k^c ) = ( A_1^c \cap A_k^c )\)

3) a) \( (A \cap B)^{c} = A^{c} \cup B^{c} \)

b) \( (A \cup B)^{c} = A^{c} \cap B^{c} \)
2.3

1)

\(P(A) = 0.4, P(B) =0.5,\)
\(P(A∩B) = 0.1\)

\(P(A∪B) = P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B) = 0.4+0.5−0.1\)
\(\phantom{P(A∪B) = P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)= 0.4+0.5−0.1} \, \,\, 0.8\)

\(P(A∪B)−P(A∩B) = \boxed{0.7}\)
