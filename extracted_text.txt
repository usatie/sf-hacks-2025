section 2.2. 

1. Three dice are tossed, one red, one blue, and one green. What outcomes make up the 
event A that the sum of the three faces showing equals 5?

2. Let P be the set of right triangles with a 5’ hypotenuse and whose height and length 
are a and b, respectively. Characterize the outcomes in P.

3. Find A ∩ B ∩ C if A = {x : 0 ≤ x ≤ 4}, B = {x : 2 ≤ x ≤ 6}, and 
C = {x : x = 0, 1,2,...}.

4. Let A1, A2,...,Ak be any set of events defined on a sample space S. What outcomes 
belong to the event (A1 U A2 U...U Ak) U (A1 c ∩ Ak c)

5. Let A and B be any two events. Use Venn diagrams to show that 

(a) the complement of their intersection is the union of their complements: 
(A ∩ B)c = Ac U Bc 
(b) the complement of their union is the intersection of their complements: (A U B)c =
Ac∩Bc 
(These two results are known as DeMorgan’s laws) 

section 2.3

1. Let A and B be any two events defined on S. Suppose that P(A) = 0.4, P(B) = 0.5, 
and P(A ∩ B) = 0.1. What is the probability that A or B but not both occur?

2. Draw the Venn diagrams that would correspond to the equations (a) P(A ∩ B) = P(B) 
and (b) P(A U B) = P(B).

3. Two dice are tossed. Assume that each possible outcome has a probability. Let A 
be the event that the sum of the faces showing is 6, and let B be the event that the 
face showing on one die is twice the face showing on the other. Calculate P(A ∩ Bc).

Rather than reflecting on each problem separately, try to reflect on growth mindset, produc-
tive failure, and grit, in general.
