section 2.2.

1. Three dice are tossed, one red, one blue, and one green. What outcomes make up the
event \( A \) that the sum of the three faces showing equals 5?

2. Let \( P \) be the set of right triangles with a 5" hypotenuse and whose height and length
are \( a \) and \( b \), respectively. Characterize the outcomes in \( P \).

3. Find \( A \cap B \cap C \) if \( A = \{ x : 0 \le x \le 4 \} \), \( B = \{ x : 2 \le x \le 6 \} \), and
C = {x : x = 0,1,2,...}.

4. Let A₁,A₂,...,Aₖ be any set of events defined on a sample space S. What outcomes
belong to the event (A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ ... ∪ Aₖ) ∪ (A₁ᶜ ∩ Aₖᶜ).

5. Let A and B be any two events. Use Venn diagrams to show that

(a) the complement of their intersection is the union of their complements:
(A ∩ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ
(b) the complement of their union is the intersection of their complements: \((A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c\)

(These two results are known as DeMorgan's laws.)

section 2.3

1. Let \(A\) and \(B\) be any two events defined on S. Suppose that \(P(A) = 0.4, P(B) = 0.5,\) and \(P(A \cap B) = 0.1.\) What is the probability that \(A\) or \(B\) but not both occur?
2. Draw the Venn diagrams that would correspond to the equations (a) \(P(A \cap B) = P(B)\) and (b) \(P(A \cup B) = P(B)\).

3. Two dice are tossed. Assume that each possible outcome has a \(\frac{1}{36}\) probability. Let A be the event that the sum of the faces showing is 6, and let B be the event that the face showing on one die is twice the face showing on the other. Calculate \(P(A \cap B^c )\).

Rather than reflecting on each problem separately, try to reflect on growth mindset, produc-
tive failure, and grit, in general.

2. Let P be the set of right triangles with a 5" hypotenuse and whose height and length are a and b, respectively. Characterize the outcomes in P.

\(a^2 + b^2 = 5^2\)
\( a^2 + b^2 = 25 \)

\( a,b \mid a^2 + b^2 = 25, a > 0, b > 0 \)

3. Find \( A \cap B \cap C \) if \( A = \{ x : 0 \leq x \leq 4 \} \), \( B = \{ x : 2 \leq x \leq 6 \} \), and \( C = \{ x : x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \} \).

\( A \cap B = \{ x : 2 \leq x \leq 4 \} \)

\( A \cap B \cap C = \{ 2, 3, 4 \} \)

4)  \( A_1 \cup A_2 \ldots \cup A_k \) \( V(A_i^c \ldots \cap A_k^c) = (A_i^c \cap A_k^c) \)

               𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)=0.1

         𝑃(𝐴∪𝐵)=𝑃(𝐴)+𝑃(𝐵)−𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)=0.4+0.5−0.1
                                                                                                                0.8
                                𝑃(𝐴∪𝐵)−𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)=\boxed{0.7}
